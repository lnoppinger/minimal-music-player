# Walk-On Music Player

The ideal music player for events, when music should be played, while someone walks on stage. With this music player it doesn't matter how long the walk-on takes, because the fade-out of the music is triggered manually.
A script to download the music in advance is included in the repo, so you aren't reliant on a stable Internet connection.

# Steps:
1. Copy yt-links for the songs
1. Modify data.json with yt-link, name and start timestamps (in seconds)
2. Run downloader.py
3. Check for errors in error.txt
4. Copy all mp3 files and musicplayer.exe on a usb-disk
5. Run musicplayer.exe and follow the instructions on the console window
